# 🌐 About SOTA-AI Community

**State-of-the-Art AI Community (SOTA-AI)** is a student-driven initiative founded by passionate young minds who have excelled at the **International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence (IOAI)**. At a time when **AI is transforming every aspect of the world** yet resources for school and college students remain scattered and limited, SOTA-AI was born with a clear mission: **to make AI education, competitive preparation, and cutting-edge research approachable and accessible to everyone.**

Our community is more than just a study group—it is a **comprehensive platform** that combines:

- 📚 **Education:** Step-by-step guidance for beginners entering the world of AI.
- 🤝 **Discussion:** An open forum where learners exchange ideas, collaborate, and challenge each other.
- 🏆 **Competitive Prep:** Specialized mentoring and practice for IOAI and other AI-related contests.
- 🔬 **Research Culture:** Exposure to state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI concepts, datasets, and projects to inspire curiosity and innovation.t
